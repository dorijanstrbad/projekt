    <pre class="lyrike">
    Back in black
    I hit the sack
    I've been too long I'm glad to be back
    Yes, I'm let loose
    From the noose
    That's kept me hanging about
    I've been looking at the sky
    'Cause it's gettin' me high
    Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
    I got nine lives
    Cat's eyes
    Abusin' every one of them and running wild
    'Cause I'm back
    Yes, I'm back
    Well, I'm back
    Yes, I'm back
    Well, I'm back, back
    Well, I'm back in black
    Yes, I'm back in black
    Back in the back
    Of a Cadillac
    Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
    Yes, I'm in a bang
    With a gang
    They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
    'Cause I'm back on the track
    And I'm beatin' the flack
    Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
    So look at me now
    I'm just makin' my play
    Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
    'Cause I'm back
    Yes, I'm back
    Well, I'm back
    Yes, I'm back
    Well, I'm back, back
    Well, I'm back in black
    Yes, I'm back in black
    Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
    Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
    Well, I'm back, back
    Well I'm back in black
    Yes I'm back in black
    Ho yeah
    Oh yeah
    Yes I am
    Oh yeah, yeah oh yeah
    Back in now
    Well I'm back, I'm back
    Back, (I'm back)
    Back, (I'm back)
    Back, (I'm back)
    Back, (I'm back)
    Back
    Back in black
    Yes I'm back in black
    Out of the sight

        Taking everything in my stride
        Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
        Ain't nothing I would rather do
        Going down, party time
        My friends are gonna be there too
        I'm on the highway to hell
        On the highway to hell
        Highway to hell
        I'm on the highway to hell
        No stop signs, speed limit
        Nobody's gonna slow me down
        Like a wheel, gonna spin it
        Nobody's gonna mess me around
        Hey Satan, paid my dues
        Playing in a rocking band
        Hey mama, look at me

        She was a fast machine
        She kept her motor clean
        She was the best damn woman I had ever seen
        She had the sightless eyes
        Telling me no lies
        Knockin' me out with those American thighs
        Taking more than her share
        Had me fighting for air
        She told me to come but I was already there
        'Cause the walls start shaking
        The earth was quaking
        My mind was aching
        And we were making it and you
        Shook me all night long
        Yeah you shook me all night long
        Working double time
        On the seduction line
        She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
        Wanted no applause
        Just another course
        Made a meal out of me and came back for more
        Had to cool me down
        To take another round
        Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
        'Cause the walls were shaking
        The earth was quaking

        And we were making it and you
        Shook me all night long
        Yeah you shook me all night long
        And knocked me out and then you
        Shook me all night long
        You had me shakin' and you
        Shook me all night long
        Yeah you shook me
        Well you took me
        You really took me and you
